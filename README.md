# leaflet-challenge

This is a leaflet challenge for module 15. 
Under static folder, and under js folder, the logic.js exists with all the codes for "Part1: create the earthquake visualization."

The dataset was retrieved from USGS GeoJSON feed page, and after creating a map and plotting earthquakes, I was able to locate markers based on their longitude and latitude, and show the magnitude of the earthquake by their size, and the depth by color. The popups show the place, time, magnitude, and depth of the earthquakes.
